## COMMUNICATION MATRIX

| Stakeholder | Channel | Frequency | Format |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| VP | Live demo | One-time (initial) | Interactive walkthrough |

## STAKEHOLDER-SPECIFIC MESSAGING

### For Executives (VP, President)
> "SKYRIDGE represents what Fort Lewis College could become - a digital experience that matches the quality of our educational mission. This concept demonstrates how AI-enabled design can create personalized, intuitive experiences that position FLC as an innovative leader in higher education."

### For Technical Teams
> "SKYRIDGE is a concept prototype exploring future possibilities. It's built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to prioritize design freedom over technical constraints. If the vision resonates, a production implementation would require separate technical planning."

### For Skeptics
> "This is explicitly a concept car - bold, visionary, and meant to inspire. We're not proposing to rebuild the website tomorrow. We're demonstrating what's possible when we apply modern UX principles and AI-enabled design thinking to higher education."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "This would be too expensive" | "This is a concept to inspire vision. Production costs would depend on scope and phasing." |
| "Our CMS can't do this" | "Correct - this is a north star vision, not a CMS template. It shows what we should aim for." |
| "Students just want information fast" | "Exactly - that's why SKYRIDGE eliminates friction and surfaces what each user needs immediately." |
| "Who would maintain this?" | "For now, no one - it's a concept. Production planning would address maintenance." |
| "What about accessibility?" | "Production implementation would fully comply with WCAG. This concept prioritizes vision." |

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

**Demo Success Looks Like:**
- VP says "Show this to the President"
- Executive asks "When can we do this?"
- Unprompted sharing: "Can I forward this link?"
- Questions about implementation (means they're bought in)

**Demo Warning Signs:**
- Focus on why it can't work
- Questions about maintenance burden
- Comparison to current CMS limitations
- Skepticism without curiosity
