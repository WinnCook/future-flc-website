## What Is This?

SKYRIDGE is a "concept car" for higher education web design - not a production website, but a vision of what's possible when we apply modern UX thinking to college digital experiences.

This prototype explores:
- **Role-based entry experiences** - Different paths for students, parents, faculty, staff, and community
- **Intelligent information architecture** - Simplified navigation that surfaces what users need
- **AI-enabled personalization** - Demonstrating how modern design can feel intuitive and responsive
- **Extended value** - Integrating local Durango context, opportunities, and community engagement
