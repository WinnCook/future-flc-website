## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document captures design patterns from elite digital experiences that inform SKYRIDGE's "concept car" aesthetic. The goal is to identify what makes certain websites feel 5-10 years ahead of typical higher education digital presence.

**Key Insight:** The "10 years ahead" feeling comes from **subtraction, not addition**—restraint, whitespace, confidence in content, and seamless user journeys that anticipate needs rather than presenting everything at once.
