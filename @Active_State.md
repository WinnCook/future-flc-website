## CURRENT SNAPSHOT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Phase** | 2 - Experience Benchmarking |
| **Status** | COMPLETE |
| **Active Task** | None - Phase 2 complete |
| **Blockers** | None |
| **Next Milestone** | Phase 3 - Concept Vision |

---

## PHASE 2 COMPLETION

**All Experience Benchmarking tasks complete:**
- [x] Researched elite university websites (Stanford, MIT, UChicago, RISD)
- [x] Analyzed premium non-education experiences (Apple, Porsche, Airbnb)
- [x] Identified "concept car" level UI/UX patterns
- [x] Documented design principles and visual direction
- [x] Created benchmark report: `intelligence/benchmarks/experience-benchmarks.md`

**Key Design Insights:**
- "10 years ahead" = subtraction, not addition (restraint, whitespace, confidence)
- Audience routing ("I am a...") as primary interface pattern
- Progressive disclosure via scroll-triggered reveals
- Emotional authority: lead with feeling, follow with facts
- Dark mode sections for dramatic reveals (showroom lighting effect)

**Benchmark File:** `intelligence/benchmarks/experience-benchmarks.md`

## INTELLIGENCE GATHERED

### Phase 1 Findings Summary

**Site Architecture:**
- 6 primary nav items: About, Academics, Admission, Tuition & Aid, Life at FLC, Athletics
- Multiple external portals fragment user experience
- No role-based entry points (prospective student vs parent vs alumni)

**Unique Value Props:**
1. Only public liberal arts college in Four Corners
2. Native American Tuition Waiver (full tuition for tribal members)
3. First Native American president (Dr. Heather Shotton)
4. Adventure Education program (unique)
5. FLC Tuition Promise (<$70K income = free tuition for CO residents)
6. 19 avg class size, 100% under 50 students
7. Location: 7,600 ft elevation, 300+ trail miles, 5 ski resorts

### Phase 2 Design Principles

**Core Principles:**
1. Confident Restraint (less is more, whitespace as luxury)
2. Intelligent Routing (know your visitor immediately)
3. Progressive Revelation (scroll-triggered, don't overwhelm)
4. Emotional Authority (lead with feeling, follow with facts)
5. Technical Excellence (95+ performance, 60fps animations)

**Visual Direction:**
- Primary: FLC Blue #003366
- Accent: FLC Gold #FFB81C
- Light background: #F8F9FA
- Dark background: #0D1117
- Hero headlines: 64-80px, 700 weight
- Section padding: 80-120px vertical
